2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Challenge Overview
 ** County and Candidate data came from various For loops and if statements.
 Analysis was started by initializing the variables I would need. All were set to zero or empty
 This section will include code snippets for each election outcome.
 
 ## Challenge Summary
 
 I am proposing that we can utilize this same script for elections in the future witha  few minor modifications.
 In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
